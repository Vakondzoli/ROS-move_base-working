#robot_radius: 0.1
inflation_radius: 0.2  # setting the inflation radius at 0.2 meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay 0.2 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost.

laser_scanner: {sensor_frame: laser_link, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true} #The "marking" and "clearing" parameters determine whether the sensor will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, clear obstacle information from the costmap, or do both.
